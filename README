This is a header-fidgeting vmod

Usage:
./configure VARNISHSRC=DIR [VMODDIR=DIR]

VARNISHSRCDIR is the directory of the Varnish source tree for which to
compile your vmod. Both the VARNISHSRCDIR and VARNISHSRCDIR/include
will be added to the include search paths for your module.

Optionally you can also set the vmod install dir by adding VMODDIR=DIR
(defaults to the pkg-config discovered directory from your Varnish
installation).

TODO

- Why is vrt_selecthttp static in cache_vrt.c?
